## Deploying and undeploying

This is a multi-cluster demo which expectects a single kube config file with the contexts of all the clusters to be used.
It makes use of  bin/run-cluster.sh which is expected to be in the $PATH. Once copied somewhere in the $PATH, run run-cluster.sh 
without arguments and follow the instructions.
