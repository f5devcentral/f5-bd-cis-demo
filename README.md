# f5-bd-cis-demo

This is a set of demos for CIS in OpenShift, using either OpenShift Routes with F5 NextGen Route augmentation or F5 CRDs which are clean sheet implementation.

Please check the route and crds folders respectively depending on the mode in which you want to use CIS. Each folder has its own description in a README file.
