# f5-bd-cis-demo

This is a set of demos of CIS integrations for OpenShift:

CIS has operates either using OpenShift Routes (optionally using F5 NextGen Route augmentations) or using F5 CRDs which are clean sheet implementation.

Please check the route and crds folders respectively depending on the mode in which you want to use CIS. Each folder has its own description in a README file.
